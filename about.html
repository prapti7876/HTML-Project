        <p>26 years of converting your travel dreams into reality!
            Starting in 1996 as a small ticketing agency with a team of three to being one of the most trusted brands in 
            the tourism industry, this journey of the last 26 years has been full of ups and downs and tremendous hard 
            work by our team. This transformation would not have been possible without the relentless trust and consistent
             support of our customers.</p>
            
             <p>The company was founded by our founder promoter, Ms. Meeta Shah, and in all these years we have become a 
                preferred workplace for women chasing their aspirations. As a result, Ms. Meeta Shah has been awarded
             “Best Female Entrepreneur of Gujarat” at the Tourism Awards Gujarat. In addition to this we have been consistently 
             recognized by many of our industry partners like Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, OTM, Hong Kong Tourism Board 
             for work. The year 2019 was a landmark year when for 3 years in a row, we were recognized by Gujarat Tourism as the 
             “Best Outbound Tour Operator of Gujarat”.
            </p>

            <p>Initially, we were operated as a ticketing agency and slowing moved into curating group as well as 
                individual holidays to South East Asia. A major milestone was achieved in 2009 when we launched our first 
                group tour to America and Europe after which there has been no looking back.</p>
